Invite Facebook friends
Every time you invite a friend on Facebook to play the game, you can get 40 Coin Master free spins. To get these codes, your friend needs to accept the invite, download the game, open it, and log into Facebook, so their account is tied to the game. If you have a lot of friends, this can add up very quickly.

Gift each other
After youâ€™ve invited all your friends and they have joined, you and your friends can gift each other Coin Master free spins and coins every day! You donâ€™t lose any personal spins this way. In total, you can send and receive 100 spins.


Wait a bit
Last but not least, you can wait! Every hour that you wait, you will get five spins adding up to 50 Coin Master free spins. That means you should wait ten hours at most if you want to optimize for maximum spins.

Coin Master tips & tricks

Donâ€™t hoard your coins!
You are always susceptible to a potential Raid taking out a large portion of your held coins. This is why you should always spend coins whenever youâ€™re able to afford a purchase. This is especially important if youâ€™re out of Shields or havenâ€™t unlocked the Rhino Pet yet!

Having a large store of coins in your pocket also makes you a prime target for Big Raids. A Big Raid is a maximum bet Raid that, if successful, can end with the Raider walking away with millions of your Coins!

Big Raids
If youâ€™ve got a ton of Coin Master free spins at your disposal, it can be tempting to want to raise your Bet amount and enjoy the multiplied spin bonus. This is a perfectly viable way of accelerating your Coin earnings. However, itâ€™s best to save your spins for Raiding very rich players.


Above the Slots Machine, you can see the Coin Master youâ€™ve been assigned as well as their current Coin stores. Save your Bets for Coin Masters with tons of coins. Since the amount of Coin you earn from a Raid is proportional to the amount of Coin the player has on them, by using only Maximum Bets on wealthy Coin Masters, you have the chance of earning a lot of money in a very short time.

If youâ€™re going for Big Raids, you should always have Foxy equipped as your active Pet. Foxy gives you another shovel to dig with on Raids, so you have an added chance of getting tons of coins.

Buy chests in every village
Individual cards donâ€™t offer any bonuses but completing a Card Collection does. You should always purchase as many Chests as you can afford when entering a new Village. Lower level Cards become more challenging to obtain as you go up in Village levels, so the early stages are the best places to get the low-level Cards you need to complete a Collection. Thereâ€™s no worse feeling than having to spend a Joker to replace the missing standard Card that you could have gotten way back when you first started playing!
